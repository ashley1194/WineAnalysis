# WineAnalysis

#### The goal of this analysis is to try to understand what makes wine 'good'. 
##### The wine dataset  was used with around 6,000 observations and 15 variables. The variable quality rating is a scale of 0-10, 0 being terrible and 10 being excellent. It is the median value from three wine experts. The models predict quality rating and understand the relationship of other varibles with quality. 
##### The code is divided into 8 parts. 
#####   1. Exploring the data
#####   2. Splitting the Data into Training and Test sets
#####   3. Handling the Missing Data
#####   4. Preparing the Test Dataests 
#####   5. Linear Regression 
#####   6. Logistic Regression
#####   7. K-Means Clustering
#####   8. Conclusions and Next Steps
